## Snapshot

| | |
|---|---|
| Active branch | `main` after PR #52 merged 2026-05-28 (Phase 14.E.2 Microsoft.KeyVault ARM frontend). Phase 14.E.3 in flight: storage ARM blob-endpoint propagation. |
| In-flight | **14.E.3 — Storage ARM blob-endpoint propagation.** Extends the Storage ARM frontend (PR #51) so synthetic StorageAccount responses include `properties.primaryEndpoints.blob` pointing at the configured blob-frontend URL. This is the missing piece for `hashicorp/azurerm` Terraform Apply through the shim — the provider auto-discovers the blob data-plane endpoint from ARM. Mechanism verified by the existing through-shim sockerless cell (asserts the PrimaryEndpoints.Blob value matches the shim's blob URL). The previously-skipped `TestTerraform_AzureBlob_ResourceLifecycle` stays skipped — auth via Microsoft Entra remains the last gap. `make sockerless` still 45 passing. Service Bus namespaces ARM still pending. Track A blocked on real-cloud credentials. |
| Last merged | PR #52 — 14.E.2: Microsoft.KeyVault ARM frontend + workflow fixes, 2026-05-28. |
| Phases 1–12 | All closed. PR index in [PLAN.md § Closed phases](PLAN.md#closed-phases-pr-index). |
| Bugs | **38 filed · 36 fixed · 2 open · 1 false positive.** Open: **BUG-8** (apigateway TF-provider Track A leg, real GCP), **BUG-15** (queue TF state-drift Track A leg, real GCP). BUG-35 closed by sockerless PR #245. |
| Upstream | **Zero open sockerless issues.** Sockerless PR #245 (merged 2026-05-27) closed #243 + #244 — ACA image platforms derived from manifest, Azure ARM endpoint hosts derived from request host across SB/Redis/APIM/PG/Container Apps. Earlier follow-ons #239/#240/#241 closed via sockerless PR #242. |
| CI | 18 required checks. Real-cloud lanes wait on Track A. |
| Renovate | Config + custom manager for vendored-spec SHAs (12.0.15). **User must install the Renovate GitHub App.** |
| Standing merge auth | **None.** User merges every PR. |
| Live infra | None. |

## Toolchain (locked-in across phases)

- **Codegen** flows through `make codegen` across three lanes: `cmd/codegen` (AWS Smithy, 5 protocols) · `cmd/azure-codegen` (Azure OpenAPI v2; 8-stage preprocessor) · `cmd/gcp-codegen` (GCP Discovery routing-only). `make codegen-check` (also runs `inject-provenance`) is the deterministic guard; CI's `codegen deterministic` job runs the same. Pipeline architecture in [docs/codegen-pipelines.md](docs/codegen-pipelines.md).
- **Vendored-spec provenance.** Every spec under `services/*/spec/` + `services/common-types/` carries a `_provenance` top-level key derived from SOURCES.md. `cmd/inject-provenance` writes it; three fetch scripts (`scripts/fetch-{aws,azure,gcp}-*.sh`) run the injector after download. CI guards: `TestEveryVendoredSpecCarriesProvenance`, `TestProvenanceMatchesSOURCES`, `TestGenHeadersCarryProvenance`.
- **Spec freshness.** `make spec-freshness` + weekly workflow (Mondays 14:00 UTC) surface upstream drift. Renovate custom manager tracks vendored-spec SHAs and opens issues on drift.
- **Signature verification.** Per-cloud verifiers under `internal/{sigv4verifier,gcpbearer,azurebearer,azuresharedkey}/` wrap every frontend at the harness layer. Test mode HS256 with project-owned key. Production RS256 JWKS is Phase 13.C. Architecture in [docs/verifiers.md](docs/verifiers.md).

## Invariants

### Process
- **Never auto-merge PRs.** Push, wait for CI green, ping user.
- **Single-branch rule.** All work for one phase on one branch; many commits, one PR.
- **File BUGs *before* fixing.** Survey first, write `BUGS.md § Open` entry, then commit.
- **Update continuity docs every significant chunk** (not just at phase end).
- **Branch hygiene.** Rebase phase branch on `origin/main` before pushing.
- **No bug IDs in code comments.** Bug lineage lives in BUGS.md, commits, and PRs.
- **One plan file.** PLAN.md is the only roadmap doc.

### Architecture
- **Fidelity to the source cloud's API.** Error shapes, headers, status codes, async semantics — match. Out-of-intersection calls fail loud in the source cloud's own error vocabulary.
- **Real backends, never emulators.**
- **Stateless shim.** No sidecar storage, no shim-managed namespace, no in-process cache treated as authoritative.
- **Intersection-only scope.**
- **Kubernetes is a first-class fourth backend.**
- **No fakes, no fallbacks, no degraded modes.**
- **Test from the official client surfaces.** SDK + CLI + Terraform per frontend per backend.
